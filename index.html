        <p class="lead mb-4">We open countless doors of compassion, education, and empathy when we let the chaos and pace of the cityscape subside, and take time to listen and communicate actively with our community members. Not only do we need to understand the â€˜societal problemâ€™ that many people face and are impacted by every day, but we need to meet and work alongside those whose daily realities are shaped by hardships or injustices, while not creating any barriers in the process.
For the past few years, I have been privileged with supervising an existing youth fellowship in a more traditional church. I primarily design and lead youth fellowship through being an active leader in a worship band, sunday school classes, vacation bible school (VBS) and contemporary congregation for youth. Some of my responsibilities include teaching young children, engaging youth in fellowship and creating a community in where one is safe to reach out with their personal problems to come together in sharing prayers and providing encouragements. From creating lesson plans to organizing a band, a congregation or a class, leading youth have been in many ways one of the most challenging things Iâ€™ve done. We may see each other once or twice a week, but on the days we donâ€™t, itâ€™s natural to encounter very real struggles, perhaps in school or home situations. As a leader, I continuously spoke life over the youth in encouraging each other when we need it most, lifting each other up when we accomplish great things and inspiring each other with positivity. One of the ways I direct communication and support in our group is by meeting up or making phone calls throughout the week in smaller groups to read together and engage in spiritual activities and conversations before coming together as one big family to share out on sunday. As a leader, I make sure all of us are on a common ground and always have someone when we need it.
<br><br>

        Another meaningful experience that speaks to me was when I volunteered at a childrenâ€™s homeless shelter in Oakland, California. Every child I played alongside, made me aware that the largest percentage of people who are homeless is in fact, not the men we see on the street who are waiting in line for food, but families: mothers, children, infants, and fathers. It is empowering to realize how much agency you have in your own life and how fulfilling it is to share that with others in hopes of them discovering it themselves. In the end, every human and every family deserves a place to call a home, a place to grow up, and a place to feel respected and comfortable. Helping the shelter to provide an afternoon of safety, comfort, and joy for children who donâ€™t have a home or much stability was a small but meaningful contribution to a much greater familial and societal obstacle. <br><br>

        Somethings I took home from these experiences are that we all have a role in improving the lives of our neighbors, and promoting a more verdant world. Our community essentially is a diverse fabric of human beings, and everyday people are affected by the issues that organizations fight for or against. Once we realize how people center things like outreach and service not just as a semblance of idealism, the connection between young people and the community can be a reciprocal and a powerful educational experience marking the beginning for social and environmental changes society advocate for every day.  Taking on a leadership position in church, I also saw myself grow in numerous ways. Not only did I learn how to make decisions and promote collaboration but I have become a lot more confident in myself as well as my agency to inspire, motivate and encourage the community as well.
